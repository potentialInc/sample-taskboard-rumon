Project Information
Description
TaskBoard is a lightweight, mobile-first project management platform centered around Kanban boards. It
enables project owners to organize work visually, assign tasks to team members, and track progress in real-
time. The platform focuses on simplicity and real-time collaboration without the complexity of traditional
enterprise PM tools.
Goals
1. Provide a simple, intuitive Kanban board experience with real-time synchronization across all users
2. Enable project owners to track team progress through automated dashboards and completion
metrics
3. Facilitate team collaboration through task comments, file attachments, and notification-driven
workflows
User Types
Project Owner: Creates and manages projects, builds Kanban boards, creates and assigns tasks,
invites team members, monitors project progress via dashboard

--- PAGE 2 ---
Team Member: Views assigned tasks, creates tasks, updates task status by dragging cards, adds
comments and file attachments, creates sub-tasks, logs time on tasks, receives notifications for
assignments and deadlines
Admin: Manages all users and projects, monitors system usage analytics, configures system
settings
User Relationships
Project Owner → Projects: 1:N (one owner manages multiple projects)
Project Owner → Team Members: 1:N (one owner invites multiple members per project)
Team Member → Projects: N:M (one member belongs to multiple projects)
Team Member → Tasks: 1:N (one member is assigned multiple tasks)
Project Type
Mobile App (React Native) - Project Owner & Team Member
Web App (React Webview) - Alternative access for Project Owner & Team Member
Admin Dashboard (React) - Admin management interface
Backend API (NestJS / Django) - Team member chooses based on their stack
System Modules (Step-by-step Flows)
Module 1 - Project Creation (Project Owner)
1. Project Owner taps "New Project" button
2. Owner enters project title, description, and deadline
3. Owner selects Kanban template (Default: To Do, In Progress, Review, Done) or creates custom
columns
4. System creates the project with the selected board template
5. Owner invites team members via email
6. Team members receive invitation notification and join the project
7. Project appears in both owner's and members' project list
Module 2 - Task Management (Project Owner / Team Member)
1. User opens a project board
2. Any user (Owner or Member) creates a new task card in a column by tapping "+" button
3. User fills in task details: title, description, assignee, priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), due date,
labels
4. User can add sub-tasks (checklist items) within the task
5. Assigned team member receives push notification
6. Team member drags task card between columns to update status
7. System updates task status in real-time via WebSocket and notifies relevant users
8. Users can add threaded comments, file attachments, and log time spent on the task
Module 3 - Kanban Board Real-Time Interaction
1. User opens project board
2. Board displays columns with task cards sorted by priority
3. User drags a card from one column to another
4. System broadcasts the change to all connected users via WebSocket
5. All users viewing the board see the change instantly without refresh
6. If a column has a WIP limit and it's reached, system shows a warning before allowing the move
7. Board auto-saves all changes

--- PAGE 3 ---
Module 4 - Progress Tracking (Project Owner)
1. Owner opens project dashboard
2. System displays overall completion percentage (Done tasks / Total tasks)
3. Dashboard shows: overdue tasks count, tasks per status bar chart, member workload distribution,
total time logged
4. Owner can filter by date range, assignee, or priority
5. Owner can export project report as CSV
Module 5 - Calendar View (All App Users)
1. User navigates to Calendar View (toggle on Board View header)
2. System displays a monthly calendar with task cards placed on their due dates
3. Tasks are color-coded by priority
4. User can tap a date to see all tasks due that day
5. User can tap a task to open Task Detail Page
6. User can drag tasks to different dates to change due dates (Owner only)
7. Week/Month toggle for different views

Suggestion Details
Suggestion 1: Team Member Task Suggestions
Current: Only Project Owner can create tasks. Team Members cannot add tasks even when they
discover work items during development
Issue: Creates a bottleneck where the Owner becomes a single point of task creation. Slows down
workflow especially in async teams

--- PAGE 17 ---
Suggestion: Add "Suggest Task" button for Team Members. Creates a card with "Suggested"
badge in the Backlog column. Owner receives notification and can approve (moves to board) or
reject (with reason). This preserves Owner control while removing the bottleneck
Expected Benefit: Faster task capture, reduced Owner bottleneck, better team autonomy
Complexity: Medium
Suggestion 2: List View Toggle
Current: Tasks are only viewable in Kanban board layout (columns with cards)
Issue: When a project has 30+ tasks, it's difficult to sort/filter across all columns. Finding a specific
task requires scanning each column
Suggestion: Add a toggle button on the Board page header: "Board View" / "List View". List View
shows all tasks in a flat table with columns: Title, Status, Assignee, Priority, Due Date, Labels.
Supports column sorting and filtering
Expected Benefit: Faster task discovery, better overview for large projects, easier deadline
management
Complexity: Medium
Suggestion 3: Overdue Task Highlighting
Current: Overdue tasks only show a red due date text on individual cards. No global indicator on the
board level
Issue: With many cards across columns, it's easy to miss overdue tasks. Owner may not realize
tasks are late until checking the dashboard
Suggestion: Add a red "Overdue (N)" badge on the board header. Tapping it applies a filter that
dims all non-overdue cards and highlights overdue ones with a red border. Push notification to
Owner when a task becomes overdue
Expected Benefit: Immediate visibility of deadline issues, faster intervention
Complexity: Simple
Suggestion 4: Inline File Preview
Current: File attachments show as a list of file names. Users must download to view contents
Issue: Extra friction for reviewing attached mockups, documents, or screenshots. Especially painful
on mobile where downloads are inconvenient
Suggestion: Show inline preview: Image files display as thumbnails (tap to expand full-screen). PDF
files show first-page thumbnail. Other files show icon with file type label. Preview loads on demand
to save bandwidth
Expected Benefit: Faster file review, fewer unnecessary downloads, better mobile experience
Complexity: Simple
Suggestion 5: Keyboard Shortcuts (Desktop/Web)
Current: All board interactions require mouse/touch (drag-and-drop, clicking buttons)
Issue: Power users on desktop find mouse-only interaction slow for repetitive actions
Suggestion: Add keyboard shortcuts for web view: N  = New task, Arrow keys  = Navigate
between cards, Enter  = Open card detail, Esc  = Close detail, 1-4  = Move card to column 1-4.
Show shortcut hint overlay with ?  key
Expected Benefit: Faster workflow for desktop power users
Complexity: Medium
Suggestion 6: Categorized Notifications
Current: All notifications in a single chronological list

--- PAGE 18 ---
Issue: Users receive mixed notifications (assignments, comments, deadlines, status changes)
making it hard to find urgent items like deadline reminders among comment notifications
Suggestion: Add tab filters at the top of Notifications page: All / Assignments / Comments /
Deadlines. Each tab shows count badge. Deadline notifications have distinct red styling for urgency
Expected Benefit: Faster access to important notifications, better signal-to-noise ratio
Complexity: Simple
